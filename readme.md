# Generative Adversarial Network written in TensorFlow

This is a Generative Adversarial Network[[1]]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)) written in TensorFlow

Everything was uncompeleted.

----
Update on Aug 12th, 2017:

Rewrite the model follow WC-GAN[[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf), which was developed by 
Alec Radford etc.

All code before were moved to the directory "ignore", please ignore them because they are just something of a mess.
